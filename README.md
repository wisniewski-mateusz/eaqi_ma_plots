# Welcome

This is a backend repository of the [wisniewski-mateusz.github.io/eaqi_ma_plots/](https://wisniewski-mateusz.github.io/eaqi_ma_plots/) site, which is a visualization complement to the *Forecasting pollutants concentration and air quality index in Poland with gradient boosted models* master thesis.

Powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) & [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/jekyll-themes/minimal-mistakes/). This repository should be a fork of [github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), but for some reason, GitHub does not allow to have multiple forks from the same repository, and I have already created [one](https://github.com/wisniewski-mateusz/submodulesIES) some time ago.
